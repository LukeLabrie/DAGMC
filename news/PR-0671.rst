**Added:** None

**Changed:**
- DagMC: updated pointer management to RAII ("Resource Allocation Is
  Initialization") technique:
   - MBI is now a shared_ptr unless passed as a raw pointer in the DagMC
     constructor (can be returned as a shared_ptr if not provided as a raw
     pointer)
   - GTT is now a shared_ptr, and can only be returned as such
   - GQT is now a uniq_ptr, (and can't be return - not change there)
- DagMC tests: 
  - DagMC instance is now a shared_ptr
  - when used MBI instance is now a shared_ptr

**Deprecated:**
- DagMC: Deprecated constructor using a raw pointer for the MBI instance,
  prefered way uses shared_ptr for MBI instance.

**Removed:** None

**Fixed:** None

**Security:** None
